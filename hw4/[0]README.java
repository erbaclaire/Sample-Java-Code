// Name: Claire Erba
// Homework 4
// Date: July 13, 2018
// Cites: 1. Summer 2018 MPCS50101 Concepts of Programming Lecture Notes.
//        2. Homework help via Piazza Q&A.
//        3. Classmate discussions with Eshwan Ramudu
// Notes: 1. LineSeg.java and  LineSegObj.java were created to assist with this assignment.
//        2. Obs.java and ObsObj.java are needed to implement Dataset.java, DatasetObj.java, and TestDataset.java but were created in HW2.
//        3. Dataset.java, DatasetObj.java, and TestDataset.java have only been changed in that they include and test two more methods
//           related to Line.java and NVLineObj.java.
//        4. DPoint.java and DPointObj.java are needed to implement LineSeg.java and LineSegObj.java but were previously created in HW1
//           (just named differently). The only change to these are the implementation of a toString() method to be able to visualize
//           output points.
//        5. New creations of HW4 are RGB.java, RGBObj.java, and TestRGB.java
//                                    Line.java, NVLine.java, and TestNVLine.java
//                                    and the two method additions in Dataset.java, DatasetObj.java, and TestDataset.java
